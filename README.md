# Customer Lifetime Value Prediction Project

This project predicts Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) based on customer purchase behavior using machine learning. It is part of the Internship Data Analytics Project.

# Project Contents

- `clv_prediction.ipynb`: Complete Jupyter notebook with data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and predictions.
- `CLV_Project_Report.pdf`: Final 1–2 page project report explaining objective, steps, tools used, and conclusion.
- `output/final_ltv_prediction.csv`: Predicted customer LTVs 
- `visuals/feature_importance.png`: Visualization of feature importance in the model.

# Note

Due to file size limitations, the trained model file `clv_model.pkl` is not included in the submission.  
However, it can be easily recreated by running the notebook, as the model training code is fully included.

# Tools Used

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (RandomForestRegressor)
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
